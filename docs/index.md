# WHOIS + Steampipe

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

[WHOIS](https://whois.icann.org/en/about-whois) is a widely used Internet record listing that identifies who owns a domain and how to get in contact with them. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain name registration and ownership.

For example:

```sql
select
  domain,
  expiration_date
from
  whois_domain
where
  domain = 'steampipe.io';
```

```
+--------------+---------------------+
| domain       | expiration_date     |
+--------------+---------------------+
| steampipe.io | 2021-10-13 19:28:29 |
+--------------+---------------------+
```
